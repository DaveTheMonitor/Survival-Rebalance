# Survival Balance Development Build

```diff
- Do not use any version below v0.1.2. These versions use BinaryFormatter to read/write data, which can be a security risk.
+ The newer versions use BinaryReader/BinaryWriter instead. Save data from below v0.1.2 will not be loaded in v0.1.2 and above.
```

Here you can choose which Survival Rebalance development build you want to download. All released development builds should be available here.
Development builds should only be used for testing and not for actual gameplay. If you do use a development build for gameplay, remember that the next version could be vastly different, and some things might break (eg. corruption of Rebalance Data).
Note: Rebalance saves data in the "rebalance.dat" file in your world's folder. The format of this data could change in the future, which may cause the data to fail to load.

To install a development build, navigate to the build's version's "Install" directory, then you can either download individual files or a zip file of the mod.
