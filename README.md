# Survival Rebalance Mod for Total Miner

Survival Rebalance changes a few aspects of survival to make it more fair. The current changes include enemy spawn tiers, locking legendary items behind a diablo kill, and changing enemy stats based on the difficulty.

Note: When installing the mod, move **every** file and folder under the "Install" folder to the mod's folder, not just the DLL. This of course refers to the mod's particular folder (eg. Mods\\Survival Rebalance) and not the game's mod folder itself. The mod comes with a config that allows you to customize various aspects of the mod as "RebalanceConfig.xml", and configurable item/enemy spawn tiers as "RebalanceTiers.xml"
